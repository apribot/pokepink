# Pok√©mon Pink (Clefairy edition)

## What?
Modification of pret's nice [https://github.com/pret/pokeyellow](dissasembly)

I like clefairy. Sounds like a good starter to me, no? A 'pink' version was allegedly considered as sister game for yellow, would have starred jigglypuff. 

## Features
- starter is now clefairy
- moves learned by level are now similar to Gen III rather than gen I, as it was unbecoming of a starter
  - Encore, and Follow Me were omitted 
  - Cosmic power was replaced with Amnesia
  - Meteor Mash was replaced with Body Slam
  - Moonlight with Recover.
- the 'talk to that pokemon following you to see how its doing' images were replaced with clefairy
  - note: I'm not an artist, so the actual eyes/mouth from pikachu were retained and the clefairy's body has no variations
