# Pok√©mon Pink (Clefairy edition)

Modification of pret's nice [https://github.com/pret/pokeyellow](dissasembly)

Idk, I like clefairy. Sounds like a good starter to me, no?

I adapted gen III's moveset because the existing clefairy moves/levels seemed unbefitting of a starter.
Encore, and Follow Me were omitted, Cosmic power was replaced with Amnesia, Meteor Mash was replaced with Body Slam, and Moonlight with Recover.
